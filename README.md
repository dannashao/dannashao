# I know little in many fields.
My knowledge base is like knowing how to Hello World in 20+ languages something:

- Data Science: At least I studied mathematics. (but B)
- Text Mining/NLP: At least I studied some of it. (but failed)
- Frontend: At least I can write some HTML/CSS/JS. (but no more than some toys)
- Backend: At least I've built a website and it's still running. (but forgort admin password)
- Machine Learning: At least I know how to use some libraries (but only knows how to copy the examples)
- Bioinformatics: At least I used to be a biology student and did some lab experiments. (but nobody cares)
- Digital illustration: At least I spent 10 more years in drawing stupid little pictures with my computer. (but still suck)

At least I know how to python/R. Schools also tried to teach me C++, Java, even asm (what an overestimation)
